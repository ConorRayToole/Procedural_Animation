# Procedural_Animation
This is very much a work in progress, I am exploring the concept of procedurally animated creatures using p5. I would love to eventually explore boids with this animation technique to get a school of fish. The bulk of important code is in the sketch.js file. This is largely inspired but this video I saw by Argonaut: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qlfh_rv6khY
